## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git
- Basic understanding of neural networks and machine learning
- Familiarity with PyTorch (preferred) or TensorFlow

### First Contribution

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nexusnet.git
   cd nexusnet
   ```
3. **Create a branch** for your contribution:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. **Make your changes** and commit them
5. **Push to your fork** and submit a pull request

## Development Setup

### Local Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nexusnet/nexusnet.git
   cd nexusnet
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv nexusnet-dev
   source nexusnet-dev/bin/activate  # On Windows: nexusnet-dev\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install development dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

4. **Install NexusNet in development mode:**
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

5. **Run tests to verify setup:**
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

### Development Dependencies

The `requirements-dev.txt` file includes additional tools for development:

- `pytest` - Testing framework
- `black` - Code formatting
- `flake8` - Linting
- `mypy` - Type checking
- `pre-commit` - Git hooks
- `sphinx` - Documentation generation

### Pre-commit Hooks

We use pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

This will run automatic checks before each commit, including:
- Code formatting with Black
- Linting with flake8
- Type checking with mypy
- Import sorting with isort

## Contributing Guidelines

### Code Style

- **Python Code**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- **Formatting**: Use Black for code formatting
- **Imports**: Use isort for import organization
- **Type Hints**: Include type hints for all public functions
- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings

Example:
```python
def process_input(
    input_data: str, 
    options: Dict[str, Any]
) -> ProcessingResult:
    """Process input data using NexusNet.
    
    Args:
        input_data: The input text to process.
        options: Configuration options for processing.
        
    Returns:
        ProcessingResult containing the output and metadata.
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If input_data is empty or invalid.
    """
    pass
```

### Testing

- **Write tests** for all new functionality
- **Maintain coverage** above 80%
- **Use pytest** for testing framework
- **Include integration tests** for major features

Test file structure:
```
tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ unit/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test_core/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test_encoders/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test_memory/
â”œâ”€â”€ integration/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test_api/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test_workflows/
â””â”€â”€ fixtures/
    â”œâ”€â”€ sample_data/
    â””â”€â”€ mock_models/
```

### Documentation
