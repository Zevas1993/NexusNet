## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies updated to their latest secure versions
2. **Secrets**: Never commit API keys, passwords, or other sensitive data
3. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
4. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
5. **Logging**: Log security events but never log sensitive data

### For Users

1. **API Keys**: Store API keys securely using environment variables
2. **Network**: Use HTTPS in production environments
3. **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
4. **Updates**: Keep NexusNet updated to the latest version
5. **Monitoring**: Monitor logs for suspicious activities

## Known Security Considerations

1. **AI Model Security**: Be aware that AI models can be subject to prompt injection attacks
2. **Data Privacy**: Ensure sensitive data is not logged or stored inappropriately
3. **Resource Limits**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. **Model Downloads**: Verify checksums of downloaded models when possible
